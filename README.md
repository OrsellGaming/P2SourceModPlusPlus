## ***A Source Engine Plugin for Portal 2 Source Mods to stop workshop maps downloading.***

One issue that plagues Source Mods for Portal 2 is the issue where the game sees that the workshop folder is empty, so it re-downloads ***ALL*** of the users workshop maps into the Source Mods maps folder. There has been no proper way to stop this from happening, so here is a plugin to solve the issue!

Simply stick this plugin and its respective `.vdc` file into a `addons` folder in the Source Mod's game directory, and Portal 2 should automatically start the plugin up with the game and thus stop the game from downloading workshop maps. That's pretty much it. This took about 20 minutes to make, so if there are any issues, make a Issue post. I'll get to it within the next 20 years.

**As of writing, 11/09/2024, the plugin is only able compatible for Windows, the signature scanner needs to be made compatible for Linux still. Apologizes for any inconvenience.**
